## trustnet

This is a real-time application for detecting fraudulent activity in a stream of transactions. The system is built using microservices architecture, with several components that work together to analyze the transaction data and detect fraud.

The key components of the system include:

- `transacto` - a microservice that generates mock transaction data and publishes it to a Kafka topic for consumption by other microservices.
- `kafka` - Kafka is used to transport the transaction data and fraud alerts between the various components of the system.
- `fraud-detector` - a microservice responsible for detecting fraudulent activity in real-time. It uses the Kafka Streams API to consume the transaction data from the Kafka topic and detect fraud using state stores, and publish fraud alerts to separate kafka toipc. 
- `fraud-alerts` - a database used to stor the fraud alerts generated by `fraud-detector` microservice.
- `transaction-database` - a database used to store the transaction data generated by `transacto` microservice.
